## What This Project Does

This project allows you to download any folder inside a repo on github.

## Requirements

You need to have installed latest node, git, npm

## Installation

### From [default NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch-github-folder)

```bash
npm i fetch-github-folder
```

### From [JSR](https://jsr.io/@nikelborm/fetch-github-folder)

Unfortunately JSR doesn't support publishing executables yet, so you can install only script library with functions that will allow you to fetch github folder from other scripts.

```bash
npx jsr add @nikelborm/fetch-github-folder
```

### From [GitHub's NPM registry](https://github.com/nikelborm/fetch-github-folder/pkgs/npm/fetch-github-folder)

1. [Generate `Personal access token (classic)` with `read:packages` scope](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Install%20packages%20from%20GitHub%20NPM%20registry&scopes=read:packages&default_expires_at=none)
2. Save the token
3. Login to Github's NPM registry (yes you need to do it, even if the package is public):

   ```bash
   npm login --scope=@nikelborm --auth-type=legacy --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
   ```

   You can also read more about `--auth-type=legacy` [here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token)

4. Enter your username when asked
5. Paste the token as password value
6. Then install the package by executing:

   ```bash
   npm i @nikelborm/fetch-github-folder
   ```

### For local development

```bash
# Clone this repo:
git clone -b main https://github.com/nikelborm/fetch-github-folder.git
# cd to it:
cd fetch-github-folder
# Install dependencies:
npm install
# Create .env file:
cp template.env .env
# Ask for token
read -sp 'Enter github access token: ' gh_token; echo;
# And immediately put it into .env
sed -i "s/\(GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN\)='.*'/\1='$gh_token'/" .env
```

## Environment Variables

- `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`: This is your personal access token from GitHub. It is used to authenticate your requests to the GitHub API. You can generate one [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Read%20repo%20contents%20access%20to%20fetch-github-folder&scopes=public_repo&default_expires_at=none).
- `GITHUB_REPO_OWNER`: This is the username of the owner of the repository you are trying to download from. For example, if the repository's URL is `https://github.com/apache/superset`, the owner is `apache`.
- `GITHUB_REPO_NAME`: This is the name of the repository you are trying to download from. In the example above, the repository name is `superset`.
- `PATH_TO_ENTITY_IN_REPO`: This is the path to the directory you want to download. It can be directory that lies inside root of repo like `docker` or it can be some nested directory like `docker/nginx`.
- `GIT_REF`: This is the commit SHA hash, branch name, or tag name you want to download from. If you don't specify it, the default branch in the repository will be used.
- `DESTINATION_PATH`: If entity at `PATH_TO_ENTITY_IN_REPO` is a file, then destination path is a path to downloaded file. If it's a directory, then all files and directories from target directory of remote repository at `PATH_TO_ENTITY_IN_REPO` will be put into a directory with path from `DESTINATION_PATH`. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be automatically created.

## How to use

1. Set env variables in `.env` file
2. Run `npm start`

## TODO by priority

1. support git LFS
2. tests
3. Better Readme
4. support creating downloading plans, where user can specify more than one entity (folder/file) to download
5. At least primitive support for passing auth tokens. Hide auth token behind Effect.Redacted (do not provide CLI option for token. only either env, or prompt)
6. write docs for exported package-symbols [jsr.io/docs/symbols](https://jsr.io/docs/writing-docs#symbol-documentation)
7. add possibility for quick request of token through browser (script opens a window and runs the request as authorized user)
8. support git submodules
9. support symbolic links?
10. better error reporting
11. support for other git providers: bitbucket, gitlab, forgejo, gitea, codeberg
12. reflect responses and determine that this is a public repo and we don't need an API key
13. test with bun, deno [lishaduck/effect-utils/platform-deno](https://github.com/lishaduck/effect-utils/tree/main/packages/platform-deno), and other runtimes, add to github action, report to JSR
14. Smart recognition and parsing of different github links and making downloading plan out of them
15. if we download a directory we already know it's contents and if it has nested directories, we can load them as subtrees in parallel
16. add retries for reliability and delay in case of rate-limits (Borrow [jpb06/effect-github-stats/.../handle-octokit-request-error.ts](https://github.com/jpb06/effect-github-stats/blob/main/src/layer/errors/handle-octokit-request-error.ts))
17. PR to octokit to make tarball endpoint return ArrayBuffer instead of unknown
18. PR to effect CLI, to properly render what env vars can be used as fallback and also what default values are.
19. Desktop URL handler, so that the CLI can handle some GitHub URLs as vscode does
20. progress bar with stages (use [parischap/effect-libs/ansi-styles](https://github.com/parischap/effect-libs/tree/master/packages/ansi-styles)?)
21. Migrate .tar.gz extractor to [leonitousconforti/feta](https://github.com/leonitousconforti/feta) when it's ready
22. add codacy, coderabbit, CodeQL, scorecard.dev
